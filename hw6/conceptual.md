#In a data science project, why does code naturally go through “phases” of messiness?
- because of the messy nature of real world data and the phases we go through to collect and clean it. through exploration and the iterative process of a data science project, it is natural to have messy phases and then we clean up the code, but often it might get messy again as we find out somthing new and so the cycle restarts.

#What are three techniques for creating more modular code?
1. create functions for repetitve actions
2. organize code into classes
3. breaking things down, taking the time to stop and organize code
