Short Answers:

1. laptops have limited compute power, limited storage, poor proximity to other resources and it is insecure. a cloud machine on the other hand has a very large compute power, large storage, can be located anywhere and thus close to other ressources and it is also a lot more secure (won't get lost, stolen or compromised).

2. question definition (define the question asked, that is being answered), data collection (collecting data in order to annotate and analyse and answer the question), data annotation (infer missing information from the collected data), data analysis (analyse, visualize data), interpretation (interpret the data according to the question defintion), communication (communicate the final result)

3. data analytics are focused on measuring things to gain a concrete new insight, using existing techniques to gain deeper insights. it invloves a lot of domain knolwedege. data science on the other hand focuses on measuing things never measured before, using innovation like building a new analysis method.

4. for example, the orginal question definition was looking at how much fluttershy speaks to others in the show, but during the data analysis, we notice that instead of counting in tokens, we should be coutning in time lenght since we are actaully interested in paying the voice actors. therefore, we need to loop back to the question defintion, and modify some things in the data collection and data annotation.
