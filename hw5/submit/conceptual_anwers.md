#conceptual question 1
Q: A hospital wants to know how its medication stocks line up with patient demand in the hospital. Develop a use case that motivates this question by identifying a persona (presumably someone who works at the hospital) and a concrete activity that will make use of this information. Of course, we don’t have access to the hospital in question – so you’ll be developing your own use case. So there are many credible answers.
A: a persona: the chief pharmacist at the hospital wants to optimize the stock amount so that it lines up with the patient demand in the hospital. This would ensure that there is less waste (expired medication due to lower need), no shortage (up to date with demands). A concrete activity would be the simple act of restocking medications. 


#conceptual question 2
Q: Why does the real world impact the complexity of code we write in a data science project?
A: Because the data we collect depends on information in the real world and things like uncertainities, inconsistencies, messy, unpredictable, and unstructured data that doesn't neatly fit into predefined models are very common. These cause inconsistences in the data we collect for the project and to deal with them, we need to write more complex code.
