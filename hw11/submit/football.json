Every new rule from Infantino seems more and more stupid to me. It's time for the bald man to go: he's only hurting football.*\n\nIn the summer of 2025, the revamped Club World Cup will be held in the USA, featuring 32 teams. FIFA may implement new rules for this tournament.\n\nSkySports journalist Kaveh Solhekol reported that clubs are required to field their strongest available squads for the World Cup. Additionally, any club that refuses to participate will be fined £445,000. Furthermore, owners cannot hold shares in more than one club.\n\nOther possible rules for the Club World Cup include:\n\n* Teams must arrive at the tournament camp 3-5 days before their first match.\n* Preliminary club rosters will consist of 26-50 players, with the tournament roster narrowed to 26-35 players.\n* Football federations will have a special transfer window from June 1-10.\n* Between June 7 and July 3, clubs may add a maximum of 2 players to their squads.\n* Players are allowed to play for only one team.\n\nSourse: [Main squads and penalties for withdrawal.

It’s like his performance level has dropped so much that no one’s even noticing him on the pitch. Has he become that invisible? Or are we just used to seeing this kind of form from him now?",

(there were +30 more influential players in the top 5 leagues)\n2. he was really bad with Brazil in an international year... (With Brazil for fucks sake, is not like he's playing for Slovenia)\n3. He does not have the numbers to think that his BdO were robbed, he has \"good\" numbers, not awesome (excluding his amazing UCL)\n4. both Vini and Rodri are victims here, but not of the BdO, they are victims of the entitlement of Real Madrid and Florentino's ego.\n\nI think football needed to rethink the awards, with Messi and CR7 it was very clear, but without them maybe we need to question what are we praising. I think Rodri is the best and most important player on the best playing team in the world and the basis of the success of spain can't be underestimated because you \"don't get it\". I also think a lot of \"football influencers\" don't understand how important and good he is.\n\nI would have given the BdO to Vini, he is incredible and has had a year to be in the conversation, maybe he even deserved to win it... But I don't see any \"injustice\" or theft, I just see a club that thinks it deserves everything without explaining why, just crying and complaining.",

And it is only because of Barcelona. And it is solely bc we won over Bayern and real in the space of 3 days. Or beat isn't the right word. We destroyed and dismantled them in such a ruthless way. And the reason it is more special than anything else is just the feeling on how long the was has been to come here. Yes I do still remember very well when we won the Champions League in 2009, 2011 and 2015, but I wasn't old enough for Barcelona to be such a big part of my life then and now we Barcelona fans have been through soo much pain and defeat. And the wins being against Bayern and Real is so so special. Bc bayern has been our outside spain rivals. All our defeats since 2013. First we lost 7-0 on aggregate, then we all know the ones from 2020 and onwards. And real well we all know that story. But for me i respected them even tho they were our rivals up until the fabricated video that they made about barca when the negreira case was on. When they made the video pretendong barca had always been franco's team and stuff something snapped in me and after that i have just lost all my respect forever for that team and now i just wanna see their downfall more that anything else. Bc that video was so bad especially with how much both barcelona as a Club but also the catalan people had to struggle under Franco it is just something that cannot be justified. And about how this time is so special it is also about our former president (the guy that shall not be named) especially from 2016-2021 did so much to destroy our club and fuck us over financially with the money he spent and the contracts he gave out. Especially with all the contracts he gave out at the end of his regime, he always made sure that the players would earn almost nothing at his time at the club, but that the wages would increase A LOT after the new president would take over. And then Laporta took over and we had to rebuild and save ourself financially. Messi had to leave which still is one of the worst things I have experienced in my whole life. Xavi came and started to turn things around and now with Flick we are the best team in the world. It is just so special that nothing can really beat this feeling!!!! And I got to see the el clasico with 4 really close friends and 3 of them are also barcelona fans so that made it even more special. And then we just were all super happy and stayed together until like 3 AM. Life is great!!! And this weekend I have a swim meet as well which makes this weekend even better.\n\nTo summarize. Barcelona my favourite team has struggles a lot the last 8 years and we are finally back. And this is the best week in my life!!!!",

        "selftext": "OK hear me out, would like an open minded discussion. This is not meant as an attack against women in sports, or in football.\n\nWoman's football is nowhere as popular as mans football. Even most women I speak prefer male football to watch. This difference is smaller in tennis, swimming or athletics, and I would argue that the difference in pay correlates to this capitalistic metric (advertising). I think this difference in 'fun to watch' has to do with the amount of times the ball gets lost and the lack of speed as a result. My thesis is that this is because the game was originally played only by men. Like so many things in health, and society, the ball is designed for a male foot, which is significantly larger (it could be the body part that in terms of size is the most significant difference excluding the sex parts).\n\nOne reason that football is so fun to watch is because it is inherently hard to keep a ball in your possession. Even Messi cannot control the ball like an average lacrosse player can defend his tiny object. Feet are less capable than hands and the ball is in itself ridiculously big when you think about it; you can't really walk past/through someone easily but you have to work together. Hence the lower scores, the endless tactical potential and the jazz like play style which a lot of people love. My point is that when it get's too hard to create something, the game becomes less fun to watch. Inaccurate passes and continues loss of the ball makes it less fun to see. This leads to unfair payment which can hardly be combatted if Ronaldo makes x times more money by doing a commercial. This is unfair, or at least unpractical.\n\nIn many sports it is normal to have different equipment for man than woman. Would this make a difference that leads to the game being more fun to watch (leading to a lot of benefits)?",

        "selftext": "For some context I come from the US. Where I’m from, most high schools (secondary schools) have teams but they usually aren’t super great. Often times teams will get a Gridiron football player and teach them how to do a do a proper throw in, and then essentially just chuck the ball into the box every time they get a throw in, in the attacking half. It’s a strategy that works very well. \n\nSo my question is why don’t more professional or high level teams utilize this tactic. Throw ins are by far the most common type of set piece. A typical professional game will see a total of 35-40 of them per game. So why don’t teams try and make full use of them? \n\nWe have seen it be very successful at the professional level. In the 2008/09 season stoke scored 24 goals off of long throws. More recently Wrexham has found success having Ben Tozer chuck the ball at their tall center backs.\n\nI suppose the issue is that the fields are larger and most teams just simply don’t have the player  that is capable of doing so. But then that begs the question why are clubs training their youth players to be able to preform long throws?  ",

        "selftext": "Before you instantly go to the replies and clown on me and call me biased, at least take the time to hear me out. First of all i mean no disrespect to arsenal, i highly respect them as an institution and as one of the most prestigious clubs in english football, but the media hype has to end.\n\nLet’s start by comparing form. Aston villa have done better in the ucl so far, getting 6 points, conceding 0 goals and beating a european giant in bayern munich. Arsenal did manage to beat PSG but failed to break down the atalanta defence and almost lost. In the premier league they’re on the same amount of points. Villa also beat arsenal twice last season and while they did lose this season i believe they played better and would have won if they just had slightly better finishing. It was an unlucky loss. Arsenal were contending for the title last season but their luck with injuries was ridiculously good. Arsenal’s depth is abysmal. They don’t have a backup RW for saka after stupidly selling nelsson, their midfield depth is poor and defence depth is good. We saw arsenal lose to bournemouth after saka and odegaard got injured. Villa were contending for the title until december when kamara tore his ACL and injuries started slowly creeping in, climaxing in an embarassing defeat to olympiacos.\n\nNow let’s talk about squads - villa have the better manager right away, this is not up for debate. If you were to do a combined 11 it’d mostly consist of villa players - Front 3 of rogers, watkins and saka, midfield of odegaard, tielemans and onana, backline of digne, gabriel, saliba and white, and then martinez in goal. That’s 6 villa players and 5 arsenal players. Villa almost definitely have better depth, with players like duran, carlos, maatsen, ramsey, barkley, kamara, buendia and philogene available from the bench. Arsenal’s bench consists of the likes of merino, jesus, jorginho, trossard, timber, tomiyasu and sterling. The quality difference is very noticeable - it takes 1 saka injury to make arsenal lose to the likes of bournemouth, whereas if any starting villa player got injured it wouldn’t be a huge problem.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share something that’s been on my mind, hoping some of you might relate or offer advice. I’ve recently moved to a new place and as someone who’s played semi-professionally before, I’ve been getting back or rather playing more football by playing pick-up games. (UK for context) It’s been a solo journey, though, and I’ve been working on regaining my form and fitness after a torn ligament that really scarred me, both physically and mentally. \n\nToday, I played a game, and it made me realize how much I’ve been trying to protect myself—both on and off the pitch. In the game, I was playing cautiously, sticking to simple passes to avoid mistakes. But that’s not the only thing. On social media, I recently posted something that wasn’t entirely true and I Just feel like I lied to be cool. I shared it because I crave respect and validation, especially in football, but it’s been eating me up inside. I feel like I’m living a lie, and that’s hard to admit. As an international I have faced discrimination which is harsh but I should not justify my actions. I am good man just been struggling.\n\nDuring today’s game, I was frustrated with another player. (Opposition) I didn’t think he was putting in the effort (Played with him before very prickish and snobbish local lad who is actually not very good), which got under my skin. I ended up saying something completely out of character: I threatened to 2-foot him after a tough challenge (Again, lying or just pretending would never do that). It was a heat-of-the-moment reaction, and I regretted it immediately. I did apologize, but I know I was in the wrong. I felt like I was being targeted on the field, which led me to lash out. Lot of pushes to me, aggressive behaviour (yes I understand I was wrong and even took it but lot of fouls and when I apologised he did not care and I quote “I do not give a f” Fair man I should be able to take it but actually I was scared. I have to be honest and shed a tear in private)\n\nThe truth is, I’ve been paralyzing myself mentally—both in how I play and how I present myself to the world. I think this is why I’ve been so focused on getting approval, especially through social media. I am bit of old school and a very good player who has not quite got the respect or chance and often misunderstood for passion. I make it a point for players around me to feel comfortable and am communicative but felt hurt and have been in the past. I thought I am a bit more grown up, played in leagues and uni but hey man, today was a bit much,\n\nAfter the game, I reflected on how football is supposed to be physical and communicative, but I took it too far. I feel embarrassed and ashamed, like I don’t know how to handle my emotions in the right way. One of the guys was class and supportive and told me to keep my head up, but it’s hard to shake off the feeling that I’ve let myself down. He also got fouled by this guy who was so aggressive towards me today and said he’s a knob anyway.\n\nI don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want to stop lying and pretending. I want to play the game because I love it, not because I need validation from others. As I’m picking up my form and fitness again, the desire to play at a higher level and competitively is returning. I want to do things the right way, and not let my frustration get the better of me.  I don’t want to be scared or alone either.  I really don’t mean to complain, world. Lot more context but the crux is I am not from here despite being here for uni, also not a drinker and smoker and focused and disciplined person but hurt by the world, often lonely and caring but very strict family\n\nI’m sharing this because I want to hold myself accountable and maybe get some support from people who’ve been through similar experiences.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "selftext": "Massive England fan here, and I'm disgusted (but not surprised) by the reaction from a lot of people to England appointing Tuchel to the job. Some of it is just xenophobia because he's German, but a lot of it is this idea that the manager has to be English and not necessarily against Tuchel.\n\nIn an ideal world, should the England manager be English? Sure, it would be nice, but let's have a look at the state of English managers shall we?\n\nThe last English manager to win a trophy across the top 5 leagues was Harry Redknapp in 2008, an FA Cup with Portsmouth. That's 16 years without a trophy for English managers in top league/cup competitions. \n\nHarry Redknapp was also the last manager to win a knockout stage in the Champions League (not counting Leicester interim coach Craig Shakespeare who took over after they fired Ranieri, who got them out of the group stage). Redknapp and Bobby Robson are the only English managers to win 5 or more games in the Champions League. These are not big requirements we are talking about.\n\nAs far as I know, the ONLY active English manager to win a top flight trophy in any European league is Steven Gerrard with Rangers. And nobody rates Gerrard as a manager.\n\nThe same issue that's been raised about England players barely playing abroad, which we are now starting to see a shift in with the likes of Kane, Dier, Bellingham, Loftus-Cheek, Tomori, Abraham...    exists with our managers. Will Still and Liam Rosenior (Ligue 1) are the only English managers to have a job in the biggest European leagues outside of England. Even leagues like the Eredivisie, Portuguese and Turkish leagues, that have massive clubs, are bereft of English managers. So for all the whining that English managers don't get the opportunity in the Premier League and foreign managers are taking their opportunities, English managers don't go abroad either. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid all have foreign managers. PSG, Bayern, Leverkusen. There are plenty of Spanish, Italian and German managers across all leagues, and they are good managers with trophies and accolades to their name.\n\nYou may think it's unfair to criticise English managers for lack of winning when they only manage in England and have less opportunities. Let's look at some more stats.\n\nFrom 1992 since the Premier League was founded until 2018, according to this [article](https://stusfootballflashbacks.com/2018/11/29/the-only-6-english-managers-to-win-a-major-trophy-in-the-premier-league-era/) only 6 English managers have won a trophy, but English managers lost 21 cup finals (10 FA cups and 11 League cups).\n\nIn 2020 both the FA Cup and the League Cup were lost by English managers (Lampard and Dean Smith). In 2021, Spurs famously sacked Jose Mourinho, serial cup winner, and wouldn't you know, appointed English interim Ryan Mason to lose another League Cup final. Was it fair to Mason? Probably not, but Mourinho could actually have won that game. And in 2023, Eddie Howe, everyone's favourite English manager, lost to Unite in another cup final. So English managers have had 31 cracks at cup silverware since 1992 and won 6 and lost 25. Ten Hag is a shit manager and he still managed to beat Pep's City in 2 finals. Let's not even get into league titles, as an English manager has never won the Premier League. We can objectively establis English managers are serial losers.\n\nThen there's the camp of people who say that in international football management trophies aren't a prerequisite, look at De La Fuente for Spain. I live in Spain, the De La Fuente appointment was crucified in the media, as was his squad for the Euros. As brilliant as they then ended up playing, they should have gone out against Germany, and they also scored in the dying moments of the final against England which should have gone to penalties. Carsley should not have been appointed just because De La Fuente did a good job, he's the exception. Scaloni won the World Cup because he had Messi, not because he's some great manager.\n\nVicente del Bosque, the architect of Spain 10-12, had already won 2 leagues and 2 Champions leagues at Real Madrid. Luis Aragonés before him in Euro 08: league with Atlético Madrid, 4 Copas del Rey with Atleti and Barcelona. Even Deschamps and Low have won league titles at club level before switching to international football. If you want to take it even further back, Lippi (Italy 06) 13 major honours for Juventus, Scolari (Brazil 02) countless Brazilian trophies, Jacquet (France 98) multiple league titles with Bordeaux. \n\nDo not get sucked in to this narrative the English media are trying to peddle about St George's Park and coming through the coaching system. The last great English managers were Bobby Robson and Terry Venables. Go and get a manager with pedigree like Tuchel, and give him a WC and a Euros. Southgate lost 2 finals, and whilst I recognise the fact that no other England manager has ever gotten to two finals, or any final since 1966, he lost a home final and a final in Berlin. Out of the whole entire world, if there are two places England have got to win in, it's England and Germany. But hey, we couldn't get it done in Germany so now we bring in a German, and I for one couldn't be happier.\n\nAnd pundits like Gary Neville and Carragher should be ashamed of themselves. Do you think Carragher would be complaining about German managers if Klopp had gotten the job? Would anyone be complaining if Pep got the job? And Gary Neville, the streets will never forget your managerial disaster class at Valencia, or the fact that you were part of the whole Southgate FA boys clubs.\n\nSorry for the long winded rant but I keep seeing all these TikToks and pundits and can't fit all of this into their comment sections. Driving me nuts.\n\n*Edit: Redknapp won with Portsmouth, not Spurs, but same year. Sorry for the mistake.\n          Howe lost to United, not City.",
