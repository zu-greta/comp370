Im not good enough, but the Coach is really supportive and wants me to participate to get better, since he likes my foundations.\n\nNow i have been training there for not even 2 months and the training is hard and i feel out of place, however, the teammates and especially the coach are very encouraging and i really admire the coach.\n\nYesterday was practice, and i wasnt sure if i should come, since i was the last week sick, but then i decided to join the training. \n\nWe were barely enought with 8 people and started with the training. \n\nWe did some spiking/blocking drilll and i felt quite good. Then there was a really close set to the net, but i tried to spike it.\n\nI spiked it, but then when i landed i saw that my foot was on the line. I got scared and saw in the same moment the coach who was blocking me landed on my foot. \n\nFor a brief moment everything seemed ok, but then his leg started shaking and twisting on my foot, he landed on the ground, and screamed. The outside band of his foot is most likely ruptured. \n\nHe most likely wont be able to conitue with the saison, and he is probably one of the most experience players in the Team and the captain.\n\nAnother player told me that the coach has already dealt with (really really terrible) ankle sprains on both ankles. \n\nHe went straight to the Hospital, i wrote him a message, apologized.\n\nHe said that things like that happens and i just have to learn from it and every is alright.\n\nI asked him to tell me the diagnosis as soon as he knows it, but he hasnt answered yet.\n\nI feel terrible and that i should leave the club. Every since i joined i had no positive impact on the training and even injured one of the most important peoples in the team.\n\nI want to play again, but i also feel to scared that something like that will Happen again.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?",

Sometimes during the summer, we even see up to 12. I‚Äôve been trying out different things to get games going smoothly, but each has its own problems. I‚Äôve tried separating the teams in half and assigning them to a court to rotate on. But that led to people complaining that they were ‚Äútoo good‚Äù for the court (some true and some not). So far what‚Äôs worked best is a queue system. First 4 teams on and winner stays on, everything after is play 2 then you‚Äôre off. Next team in line fills into whatever court finishes first. This has been good besides the long wait times, but that‚Äôs a given considering our limited facilities. If anyone has any alternatives it‚Äôd be appreciated. Something to bear in mind is that we‚Äôre technically a community center, so we can‚Äôt have a cut off for teams.

        "num_comments": 53,
        "selftext": "I've been seeing a ton of posts on desire to jump higher, or critiquing technique and figured now is my time to shine.\n\nI started playing volleyball when I was 20 and had no previous experience with jumping. I did all sorts of sports that were very non-explosive (Soccer, XC, Swimming) and had no business jumping. When I first got into volleyball I couldn‚Äôt even touch the bottom of a basketball hoop netting. My vertical was less than 20‚Äù, I‚Äôm undersized (5‚Äô10‚Äù) and my body knew nothing about getting off the ground. This had me pretty motivated to control what I could by increasing my vertical. Over my 10+ year journey of increasing vertical from 18‚Äù to 36‚Äù I‚Äôve learned quite a few nuggets. I‚Äôm by no means a professional, sports scientist, kinesiology major, etc‚Ä¶but I‚Äôve done a ton of reading, trial and am a personal testimonial. That said, here is my attempt at streamlined advice on jumping higher.¬†\n\n# Body Composition\n\nFat don‚Äôt fly. Simply put, you need to decrease your body fat% as much as possibly, while still staying athletic. I add that last part because there are body builders that have 7-10% body fat, but it wouldn‚Äôt translate well to sport. There is such thing as useful abs vs aesthetic abs. If you are overweight you need to cut weight through diet and exercise (preferably heavy lifting). Ideal BF% would be 10-15% range (15-20% for women). There are a boatload of resource on cutting weight while keeping strength, but a good starting point would be the FAQ in r/fitness\n\n# Lifting¬†\n\nYou need to be able to move heavy things very quickly. Lifting explosively is the best way to translate weight room movements to volleyball. The preferred lifts are fully body movements such as olympic lifts, squatting, deadlifting. When doing these lifts you want to do low reps (3-5 sets of 1-6 reps) and heavy weight. You want to complete the lift as fast as possible, while keeping good form. A good example would be doing the eccentric movement of squat at normal or even slow pace, and when moving back to the top of the lift, you move the bar as fast as possible. You can do any sort of lifting regime you‚Äôd like (preferably full/lower body), as long as you‚Äôre gaining strength. Your goal should be squatting 1.5 to 2x your body weight. Once you hit that, you should start introducing plyometrics back into your routine. Once again, you can get a ton of info on lifting from r/fitness. I‚Äôd suggest taking any lifting program and adjust the plan to low reps, heavy weight and performing the movements quickly yet safely.¬†\n\n# Muscle Fibers\n\nNow to some boring yet very necessary shit. You have two types of muscle fibers (slow twitch and fast twitch). These muscles fibers are developed over years of activity, genetics, and childhood. Some people are born with a high amount of specific fibers based on genetics and others develop it through childhood play. You can train towards increasing the amount of specific fibers you have as well‚Ä¶this takes time, but will change. Fast twitch fibers are used for explosive movements (jumping, sprinting, etc) and slow twitch fibers are used for longer, slower movements (walking, long distance running, etc.)\n\nThis all translates to 2 types of jumpers (bouncy and power). If you are born with fast twitch or had a childhood that promotes explosive movements, you‚Äôre more likely a bouncier more natural jumper. If you were born with slower twitch muscles, or had a childhood that promotes more endurance based activities, you are probably more of a strength based/power jumper. It is important to determine what type of jumper you are in order to implement the proper exercise/lifting program for you.¬†\n\nSpringy/Bouncy jumpers are traditionally more fluid. It almost looks like it‚Äôs easy for them to jump/move quickly. Think of the whole Japanese volleyball team. Those types of jumpers USUALLY don‚Äôt have a lot of strength and should really focus on lifting heavy. They need to move heavy shit fast and gain as much strength as possible. Low reps, high weight, lift to failure (or close to failure) and do so 3-4 times per week.\n\nPower/Strength based jumpers are traditionally stronger, and look a lot more powerful when jumping. Think of Earvin Ngapeth, Matt Anderson or guys that use a lot more of their body to jump. Those types of jumpers USUALLY have a lot of strength, but don‚Äôt have much explosiveness and should focus on plyometrics. They need to jump, bound, sprint, and do plyometrics that will help generate more fast twitch fibers. Doing these workouts are harder on the body if done at max effort so 2-4 times per week. One day could be 5-10 sprints of 40m. One day could be a jump workout. One day could be playing an explosive sport (volleyball, tennis, basketball, football). One day could be a jump workout. One day could be a plyo workout doing depth jumps, hex bar jumps, squat jumps, and bounding. You will need to listen to your body as overdoing it could have your knees screaming at you. It‚Äôs harder to see results doing this type of stuff vs seeing numbers increasing in the weight room, so a fun measure would doing bi-weekly or monthly vertical jump test. You could tinker with going off one, off two, goofy footed, etc. At the end of the day, you‚Äôre wanting to do as much bouncy activity as possible, while staying healthy.¬†\n\nIf you‚Äôre between these two (TJ DeFalco is a perfect example), or don‚Äôt know what type of jumper you are, doing a combo of both of these will benefit you. You can lift twice a week, and then do explosive workouts twice a week. I‚Äôm to the point where I have decent bounce and strength, so I will cycle my workouts. In the winter I will go all strength based, and then in the summer I will do all explosive based. Whatever helps keep your mind into it will be the best thing!¬†\n\n# Technique\n\nThis alone can increase your vertical immediately. Jumping is a practiced movement, and takes time to become efficient. In volleyball you want to jump off two feet from a 3 or 4 step approach. Your 1st/2nd step(s) should be slower and you should be more upright, and when going into your penultimate step you need to have a long aggressive stride, and use your whole body to drive towards your block step. Use your last step to plant and move vertically while simultaneously extending your core/hips and lifting your arms aggressively. This is very hard to explain via text so my two recommended resources would be¬†\n\n1. Project Pure Athlete on Instagram. He can be very salesy, but he has very good guidance on form, and has exercises that can work on this form.¬†\n2. Coach Donny on YouTube has videos out there that translate jumping to volleyball.¬†\n\nPPA is more jumping for vertical results, and then Donny is more volleyball based approach. Finding a good baseline from PPA and then implementing that to a volleyball approach is your best bet for proper technique. The best way to get better with technique is jumping. Practice jumping, tinker with your form until it feels or looks right. Record yourself and compare it to what PPA or Coach Donny says about technique.¬†\n\n# Flexibility Myths\n\nOver my years of pursuing a higher vertical, I have yet to find any well-backed research that proves stretching, flexibility, etc. helps increase your vertical. In fact, some research shows that it hurts (this research is also not conducted well). If it helps you feel good, then that‚Äôs great. That said, until proven otherwise, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wasting your time with different stretching routines before or after jumping/playing. The best warmup will be a dynamic warmup that gets your heart rate up, and legs feeling efficient/strong.¬†\n\n# Quit Doing Slow Twitch Movements\n\nLong distance running and sports like soccer that involve distance are terrible for your vertical as it generate slow twitch muscles. These are big no-no‚Äôs for your goals. Cut out any activities that involve this type of stuff and replace it with lifting or sprints. If you are running or playing sports that generate slow twitch, this will slow your progress immensely.¬†\n\n# Rest and Recovery\n\nThe last and least fun part of this is letting your body recoup. If you‚Äôre jumping/lifting daily, your body has no time to change/grow. You need to have off days especially with explosive workouts. These workouts are harder than traditional lifting regimens, and require more rest. Huberman Podcast has a ton of phenomenal guidance on optimizing sleep and recovery.¬†\n\n# Read Vertical Jump Bible\n\nThis is essentially an abridged version of the vertical jump bible with some additional information I've found over the years. Both vertical jump bibles provide more in depth details on a lot of the stuff I posted here, so I'd recommend checking those out as mentioned in the FAQ\n\n# TLDR:¬†\n\n* Body Fat Percentage should be around 10-15% (15-20% for women) for optimal performance.\n* Determine what type of jumper you are.\n   * Bouncy Jumpers should do low reps, high weight of mainly full body movements. Do these lifts fast.\n   * Strength Jumpers should develop more fast twitch muscle fibers by jumping, sprinting, bouncing and other plyometrics.\n   * Doing both strength and plyometrics will do wonders for anyone that doesn‚Äôt know what type of jumper they are, or are an in-between jumper.\n* Improve jump technique by checking out Project Pure Athlete on Instagram, Coach Donny on YouTube, and by continuing to jump!\n* Don‚Äôt waste your time stretching\n* Stop distance running\n* Rest!!!\n* Read both Vertical Jump Bibles",

Also, every gym teacher and coach in our school is also white, and I‚Äôve noticed the same popular white kids who have been in their classes getting picked for every single team. It really sucks because I really would have loved to be on the team, and have been trying my best and doing really well in tryouts.

I think part of it is she thinks she is letting me down and I am disappointed in her. \n\nI fear I've ruined her enjoyment for playing. What can I do? Language is also a barrier.

        "selftext": "I started a rec/coed volleyball league in March. I liked it quite a bit so I signed up for another day my second session, and this session I'll be doing four a week (remains to be seen if that's overkill or not lol). \n\nI've gotten much better at receiving, especially overhand. I can often go straight into a set on the first hit even if it's a tricky one, and I'm rarely the one to drop the ball. Last week everything from the read, timing, and distance seemed to click and I got five successful blocks too. However, my spike still sucks bad when I thought it would be my best asset.\n\nI'm 6'1\" and my standing reach is slightly over 8 feet. However, I always feel like if I spike hard it will go into the net or out of bounds. I basically flick my wrist down without much elbow or shoulder movement to ensure I keep it in, but obviously this results in a pretty light hit that is less likely to score. \n\nI should be strong enough to hit pretty hard, but psychologically I feel like I'll either hit it out, hit it into the net, or hit the net with my hand. Part of this is I feel like I'm not getting any air on my jumps. I was 270 at the start of this year as I was previously competing in strongman and I definitely wasn't jumping super high, but now I'm at 245 and my teammates assure me I am almost up to my shoulders on the net when I jump even if it doesn't feel like it. Also tried to touch a basketball rim at one of the gyms just to check and I got high enough to wrap at least my finger tips around it.\n\nOn serves also, I was a actually *better* in March/April. At one point I got 8 aces straight. Now every time I try to hit it hard, it goes out. It's like the next is too high to give it speed and still get it to come down in bounds...Even though I was doing it before. I can get my serve in every time and almost never miss, but only by hitting it lightly and they're not fast enough to ever be a point. Try to add some speed, and it goes out or into the net. \n\nThen I see other people who are shorter than me or not jumping as high hit the ball HARD and get it to come down in the middle of the court...How are they doing this? Other players have said it's the spin, but how do you hit the ball differently to change its spin without also changing its direction? And how do you handle all this at the same time as coordinating your jump, swing, ball location, and the positions of the other team? üòµ‚Äçüí´\n\nDo I just need more practice to get a feel for it? I only ever really get to spike in games and even then, most of my teammates are not good enough at controlling the ball for us to get consistent bump/set/spikes, so I don't get to do it often. \n\nAny insights/advice would be appreciated.

        "selftext": "I'm staying in Hong Kong for a while and wanted to buy a better volleyball during my stay.\n\nResearching about other people's experience led me to believe that the Molten V5M5000 might be a good choice for me. I played volleyball for about a year back when I was 17 years old, and now, 15 years later, started again since about a year ago, but only in my grandpa's sports club where it's mostly 50+ age people (except for me and another grandson who shows up occasionally).\n\nSo I was hoping to get a ball that handles well enough to be fun and make people feel pro enough to have some ego stroke yet soft enough to not hurt hands and arms more than necessary. From what people were saying (\"softer than Mikasa\" in particular) I felt hopeful with the Molten V5M5000.\n\nInitially I wanted to buy a volleyball from a local shop, but given how cheap and easy it is to import from China through Taobao to Hong Kong, I figured I might as well order from Taobao directly, where I can return it for free with little hassle if it turns out to be fake.\n\nThere are plenty of \"Molten\" and \"Mikasa\" volleyballs listed there, and the first listing I found that looked trustworthy (sold by \"Tmall Molten Fenhu Store\", with a couple hundred sales and 50 positive reviews) had the V5M5000 model for 265 RMB, which is about 38 USD or 35 EUR. It included a carrying bag and a cheap no-name brand ball pump.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect, figuring that it was most likely going to be a fake, but if it felt much better than my 15‚Ç¨ Goma VB20 ball that I bought from a local shop last week, I might still keep it, otherwise back to the seller it goes.\n\nThe ball arrived today, and I am pleasantly surprised with the production quality. The seams and prints all look clean and the surface feels nice.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64c6qafwv90e1.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65d66c3c330fd87d8719bf25d37f8bffca4cf048\n\nAs to whether it's genuine: it came with a little business card with a verification number hidden under a scratch-off layer. The verification number is specific to the Molten China website.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ex6mambtv90e1.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=690ce88d1e4f681c7d2f2d05f9ef84c1e013dcc0\n\nFor a bit, I thought this was just a very elaborate part of a scammer trying to minimize his product return rate, since the [website](http://www.molten-china.com/) doesn't have HTTPS and looks like it's stuck somewhere between 2005 and 2015, design wise. While I don't have a problem with the design ([this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sz6kyt/modern_web_design_is_trash_web_design_peaked/) could have been written by me), it's a stark contrast to the current English and Japanese Molten websites which look much more modern.\n\nHowever, the official website indeed links to the same URL in its [\"Molten Global Network\" page](https://www.molten.co.jp/sports/en/network/). On the Molten China website, the bottom left corner has a blue rectangle with the number 16 in it, this links to their genuine check verification, which is hosted on an [external website](http://www.581315.com/CodeQuery/AntiCodeQuery.aspx).\n\nMy ball's code was 8011 3884 015 95923. After entering it for the first time, it told me that it's a genuine ball. When I entered it for the second time, it told me that the code was entered before (showing the date) and that if that date does not coincide with me entering the code for the first time, the ball might be fake.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8orktyttw90e1.jpg?width=2304&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3baa5debe62aed5aa084225658607cbb346f5deb\n\nFrom my understanding, this indicates good practices (apart from the websites not having HTTPS, which will likely throw some people off) and that the ball is indeed genuine.\n\nI haven't played with the ball yet and am about to put air into it for the first time. Since I could not find any discussions when searching for \"Molten volleyball Taobao\" that had people comment positively about whether Molten volleyballs on Taobao are genuine, I'd figure it's a good idea to post something that people can look up. \n\nI can't ascertain with 100% confidence that the ball really is genuine ‚Äì it's not impossible for Molten's partner (?) who maintains the China website and the genuine check system to also sell counterfeit balls, without Molten having noticed it (yet). But I think that's really unlikely and the ball looks so well-made that I'll trust the ball to be genuine until I happen to meet someone who has a genuine one and can show me the difference.",

I CAN. i also think im a bit quicker. and im much more talkative on and off the court, im always congratulating my teammates after and during a play. i especially try to tell our setters they made a good set, and passers a good pass, since i know they dont get congratulated as often as attackers do when they get a good kill. i also cheer very loudly. its so frustrating because my coach SEES i have so much ambition, she told me herself, and here we are almost at the end of the season. i feel there isnt a drastic difference between me and our main libero. i just cant help but think what player i could have become if i got the same opportunity as her. and then im blaming myself for being too nervous the first few weeks, i could have proven to my coach i can do the job.\n\nto add salt to the wound, i only get played the 2nd or 3rd set. lately its been the 3rd. and i dont start the set either, so im only playing about 15 points. \n\nand my coach expects me to perform as well as our main libero, when i have been benched practically the whole time. i can try but what am i supposed to do!? \n\nplease comment anything with advice it would be greatly appreciated ",

I've expressed this multiple times to my coach and team and was mocked, but there aren't even any teams near me that I can maybe talk to and settle something. My emotions overall while playing libero are bad, I just get demoralized seeing someone on my team 2cm taller play my position, doing shit and still being able to play that position for some reason. Is there any way I can resume my growth? My mum is pretty tall for a lady in my country and my dad is 175/180cm or so.

Our goal for the site is to simplify the admin side of running tournaments by helping with things like format setup, generation of schedules, tracking results and determining the standings as well as provide a mobile friendly, simple to use, modern UI for people participating in the tournament.¬†\n\nThis summer we had a bunch of Canadian youth baseball tournaments use the site and the feedback was really positive. We collaborated quite a bit with the baseball community to help update the site to really fit with their setup. Adding things like custom game stats, new tiebreak rules and custom bracket formats.¬†\n\nWanted to share the site here because we‚Äôd love to do the same with the volleyball community. We think the site could be really helpful for people running tournaments especially if you don‚Äôt already have a good option for managing your tournaments. We‚Äôd also love to hear any feedback on the site and hear what you like or don't like and how we might be able to update it to better work with your tournaments.  \n  \nHere‚Äôs an¬†[example tournament](https://tourny.ca/t/volleyball-championship)¬†I put together and a ¬†[short youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqTYy3_BQEU&amp;ab_channel=Tourny)¬†that gives an overview of the site. Check it out and let me know what you think!\n\nAlso here are a few screenshots to get a sense of what the site looks like:\n\n[What the players see \\(home page, games, standings, bracket\\)](https://preview.redd.it/s4wlcgfdxuzd1.png?width=1972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1b6ef8378a72ec25cba558049fcad4f5203c989)\n\n[What the admin sees \\(manage tournament, run tournament, submit score, transition to playoffs\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/q3rvyaitxuzd1.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac744c47b0d6dfa595bf331943f5d7a05eddb7c9)\n\n",

(Which to me personally seems large). \n\nHe has never played with an organized team, but he and his friends play on a local court all the time and they decided to try out for the team. There are some kids on the team who are very good and he and everyone else does recognize that. However, there have been 3 games so far and the coach has not put him in once. He mentioned to us as well that at practices his coach doesn‚Äôt like putting them (bench warmers) in scrimmages because she wants the ‚Äústarters‚Äù to learn how to play and play together. I want to know if this is normal? She put him in the scrimmage yesterday, but with all of the kids who also are benched, so they obviously bombed and got beat by the kids who constantly play and practice. In my head I don‚Äôt understand how he‚Äôs supposed to get better if she doesn‚Äôt talk to him much, doesn‚Äôt give him things to work on, doesn‚Äôt really let him practice, and then doesn‚Äôt put him in games. To me, middle school sports doesn‚Äôt really matter so I don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs insanely focused on winning. He‚Äôs not the only one either, there are about 6 boys who just bench warm and don‚Äôt play. Why would she have taken him on the team if she‚Äôs not even gonna try and help him get better or let him play the sport he loves? He‚Äôs obviously getting down in his spirits about it and I just want to help. Please be nice if I sound ignorant I truly don‚Äôt know how these things work I didn‚Äôt play many sports in school lol thank u!!",

It's my first semester, and I have pretty much met all of the regulars there, but I'm struggling to actually be able to play. I don't think I'm bad, probably exactly average of all the people who are playing, but no one picks me up, and if I try to form a team to play, the line to play is so long most people leave before it's my time to actually play on the court. I think I would get picked up more if I improved, but I really don't know how. My grandma is a coach so I could ask her, but I only have one day of the week off in the first place so practice and improvement would be really slow. I would love to join an actual team so I can get used to playing with a specific set of people and they could help me improve, but I have no idea how to go about that or how to see if there are any sort of rec leagues in my area. So, what do I do? I kinda struggle to make friends too (I think I put people off), so getting to know a group at my Uni seems... Weird to do, I guess. I'm 99% sure I would just get shut down, as the majority of them have known each other for years. I'm also transferring colleges next August so pretty much every relationship I form here is gonna turn into long distance at best. For reference, I play setter, I'm 5'9, 130lbs, my vertical is (with an approach) ~9.5 ft and I do know 5-1 rotation. I've never been on a team before either, as my high school didn't have one until my senior year, and I was too busy working to join it. Help?

        "selftext": "*UPDATE BELOW\n\nTL;DR: I joined an new league. During my teams last game our opponent claimed that men should not block women's shots during coed play. I've never encountered this before and I (and my team) don't understand why this would be enjoyable for anyone. I'm looking for some outside perspective.\n\nHi volleyball reddit,\n\nI recently moved to a new city and joined an adult rec volleyball league. During our last match the other team stopped us midway through the first set to tell us we were violating the \"rule\" that men cannot block women's shots during coed play. I asked if this was a league rule or just some unspoken thing among the players, but they wouldn't give a clear answer. We went with it since there was no ref present (staffing shortage at the facility) to clarify, and my team is all new to the league.\n\nI thought this was unusual as I've been playing in similar leagues for years and never heard of any rule like this, either official or unspoken, so I emailed the league to clarify. Turns out it's not an official rule, so maybe it's just something among the players, although I have my doubts about that as well as none of our previous opponents (including this same team a month ago) have said anything. It was a little suspicious that they only brought this up after we took an early lead, and after we resumed play they started always having a woman hit it over. For the purpose of my question though I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the previous teams just felt too awkward to say anything.\n\nMy question is, why would anyone (male or female) enjoy playing with such a rule in place? And should we agree to play by it if it comes up again? I discussed it with my team after the game and got 3 responses:\n\n* 1 player (female) liked the rule and thought it levelled the playing field\n* 2 players (1 male 1 female) didn't care either way, but think we should go along with it if it comes up again to avoid conflict with other teams\n* 3 players (all female) were strongly against the rule. They said they felt disrespected that they were not being treated as equals on the court, and that it was sexist to imply they weren't capable of playing a competitive game against men. It may be worth noting that 2 of these women are recently graduated D1 college athletes in another sport, and are easily more athletic than any of the men on my team or the opposing team.\n\nPersonally I (male) agree with the last group. I discussed it with them and we didn't understand why the rule would be fun for anyone involved. We were confused for the following reasons, and I'm hoping reddit can provide some insight:\n\n* We don't understand why women would sign up for a coed league if they aren't ok with playing volleyball under the normal rules against men. The facility offers a women's league as well, why not just join that instead?\n* We don't understand why men playing would find this rule enjoyable. Most people in the league have limited free time due to work, kids, and other commitments. We don't see why anyone would use their limited free time to drive all the way to the facility and not play their hardest. It seems unfulfilling.\n* We don't understand why anyone would want to play against an opponent that isn't trying their hardest. What's the fun in playing a game when your opponent isn't trying their best to win?\n\nI'm also looking for advice on what to do if a future opponent brings this up. I'm the captain, so it falls on me to decide whether or not we agree to any unofficial rules. I'm inclined to reject the rule and tell opponents that \"we're going to play our hardest and we hope you do as well\", since that's what the majority of the team favors. Does anyone have any thoughts on either the (unofficial) rule itself or how I should handle it? I'd love some outside perspective\n\nEdit: In case it matters, the net is at men's height, and there is an (official) rule in place that a woman must hit the ball before it goes over, assuming there is more than one total hit\n\nEdit 2: I should probably also add that the \"blocking\" isn't some highly skilled thing where we're smacking it down onto their side of the net. This is a low-level league and we aren't that good, so most \"blocks\" just bounce back over and are fairly returnable\n\nUPDATE:\nI just got back from today's game, where unfortunately there was a whole thing about the rule again. My team remained divided on how to handle it, but we decided to just each play how we wanted. I opted to block all players equally while the other two men in attendance decided not to so as to avoid potential conflict.\n\nWell if you hadn't guessed yet, there was conflict. Right from the start of our first set the other team's captain would complain every time I went up for a block against a woman. He wouldn't complain directly to me, but he was loudly insulting me to his teammates while I was in the front row, so he must have known I could hear him. I didn't feel like starting a fight about it so I just pretended I didn't hear. This continued throughout the whole match. After the last set I skipped the usual high fiving with the other team since I didn't feel like saying \"good game\" after how they treated me. I didn't do anything dramatic, just walked over to the bench to drink some water. Naturally this was wildly offensive to the other team, and a few minutes later one of them walked over and said to my wife and other teammates \"You're all amazing, except for that guy, he's a douche\" while pointing directly at me. Once again I was like 15 feet away, so I can obviously hear them.\n\nFunny thing is I didn't actually block any of the shots, they all went way over my head. The only successful block I made the whole match was against a man. I mentioned it to the ref on the way out and she said the other captain has been playing there for years and he's \"always been an a******\", so I'm guessing this isn't the first time this has happened. I get that he wasn't happy about it and he's entitled to his opinion but this just seemed excessive. Additionally, it seemed hypocritical that he would complain about me taking advantage of a favorable matchup when they were clearly and repeatedly targeting our weaker players. Again, I fully expect any opponent to play their hardest and go for our weak points, but it's bizarre to me that they would complain about me doing effectively the same thing",

Also I am afraid that I will break something in my room if I were to hit it at full extension as I have a lot of power even if my technique is bad haha.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1gl67ys/video/j4t5zm5axbzd1/player\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1gl67ys/video/rqp9om5axbzd1/player\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1gl67ys/video/1407nl5axbzd1/player\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1gl67ys/video/5qdaxn5axbzd1/player\n\n",

Sometimes my right leg even gets bent while my left leg doesn‚Äôt.\n\nI think both legs should be placed (almost) horizontally, which I also admire cuz it enables my upper body to be fully rotated. But since I am doing that, I only use some of my rotational power and arm strength when I spike. Hitting straight is difficult too. My form doesn‚Äôt look good asw.\n\nWhat is causing this and what can I do to fix it?",

I feel like the obvious choice of a system is a 3 middle, but I do not really like to stray from a classic 5-1, but by FAR my weakest position is outside, as I am probably going to have to spin one of my liberos as an outside, due to the lack of quality. \n\nThe middles will start in 2, 4 and 6, Setter in 1, and OH1 in 5 and OH2 in 3. Libero pulls my OH2  (he is not a good passer, but is probably my best pin swing) and MB in 6, and I have 2 serviceable players to DS the MBs in 2 and 4.\n\nMy question is how has other's (coaches and players) experiences been running this offense. I do love a 5-1 myself, I just do not feel like sending my boys into their first tournament in a 5-1 is a great idea as I will have at least one weak link in defense/receive and one of my 3 best hitters on the bench, when I could always have 1-2 up front at all times.\n\nAny comments or concerns you have had with the triangle would be appreciated!

I've seen many teams do this and I was wondering if it was a widely used strategy.\n\n2. if on the first touch the ball went out of bounds on the other side but the team manages to get the ball back over the net with the second touch how does that work? I've seen some instances of this being allowed and this not. (I'm sorry if the description is a little confusing)\n\n3. what are the rules surrounding double touch?

        "selftext": "I ordered a 2024 Olympic Game Ball V200W back in October 5. I soon contacted them through both directly replying to the Shopify confirmation mail (which I know they WILL receive it by doing this way) and mail to several different address they have listed on the Internet, to cancel the order, which all of my mails are replied by Microsoft Outlook mailing system saying that they are denying my access.\n\nI placed the order at 4.45 PM and contacted them immediately around 5.10 PM same day.\n\nLucky enough, I received thier reply in October 6 from one of the mails I've sent, and the Shopify cancellation at the same day; also another agent replied to my another mail in October 7, so they *definitely* know and agreed that my order has been cancelled.\n\nYet, in October 25, I received a package from them, exactly what I ordered back 20 days ago. I immediately mailed them by replying one of the mail that their agent has sent me, asking how should I mail the package back because since I've cancelled my order and this shouldn't belong to me.\n\nThey replied to me at the same day (Oct 25) asking if the payment has also been cancelled. To my suprise, the payment still listed in my unsettled bills. So I replied to them with this information and hoping them to provide a solution to this situation.\n\nI've got no any reply from them ever since.\n\nEven I have mailed them through different channels multiple times, contacted PayPal (and PayPal demand me to wait for their response, but still nothing from them), they are not still responding to any of my mails to this day.\n\nThis is not that I'm paying for what I received. Not even compulsive consumption. They are using me to compensate their administrative negligence, by not proceeding my cancelled payment, and try to justify either to themselves or any regulatory authority (if I can find any, and sadly they are registered in Switzerland, a country seems lacking of customer protection) that they are changing me in consideration of what I've received but not asked for.\n\nAfter looking up their names on Reddit it seems I'm not the first case. Very vulgarly of their business practices and I'm disgusted by them. I would not recommend making any purchases of item or service from this company.",

        "selftext": "Hi, so I currently have two problems which are kind of the same but different.\n\nNumber 1: On our club A-Team (We are reasonably good. Semi-Pro level), we are currently trying to improve out our Sideout%, with the goal being about 70% and our current rate being about 50-55. To that end, what needs to improve the most, are recieves, which are just about the worst in the league. Overpasses and aces are way too frequent (4-6 per set!!). As part of that improvement, a suggestion of coach was to fight off the balls about 3-4 meters off the net on a tough serve. This works well and I (setter) get to set a lot more, even out of position. \n\nNow here's the problem: When the ball is far off the net, we do not want to run a normal, middle quick. We run a quick-set where the MB hits between position 3 and 4 (as a lot of teams do)... however, it is extremely difficult to communicate to the MBs (they're young, explosive but not very experienced) that they should run the other play. It comes down to: Ball far off -&gt; run to OH; Ball close -&gt; run to S\n\nThey're simply lacking the awareness to notice these things.\n\n  \nProblem 2: As I also am the coach of a local High-School team, I have to teach a lot of people who never played the game stuff like: get away from the net, after the ball comes over, get close to the net if the other side has it, look where the setter and the recieve is for timing and so on.\n\nIn my experience, the only thing that truly helps is just reps after reps. \n\nSo I'm wondering. Does anyone here have a better idea on how to teach situational awareness?\n\nThx",

        "selftext": "Hello. My daughter (HS sophomore) started playing for our small private school 2 seasons ago. There are only 7 other players on her team, most of which have 1-3 more seasons under their belts. There were no tryouts and they actually had to pull 3 middle schoolers up because there were not enough high schoolers that signed up. I know my girl isn't on the same skill level as everyone else. Her overhand is still not perfect. But her setting is amazing. \nHere is where it gets tricky. Her coaches will only play her \n1. If it is a non-competitive game or \n2. If they are 15-20 points ahead.\n\nWhich means she sat on the bench for the last 2 tournaments. (They did play her for a couple minutes when it was 22 vs 7) So out of the 12 hours of games, about 5 minutes total playing time.\nShe tried talking to the coaches multiple times and the answer is always \"maybe next time \" or \"join the winter league and we will play you more\".\nThey also have 2 other players who get minimal time and only switch them for each other. The other players are their own kids and literally are always played. (I generally am scorekeeper so it is not just emotions talking üòâ)\nIf they were all perfect players, I would TOTALLY get it. But the amount of errors that happen has gotten worse over the season. Specifically ball not getting over the net when serving and double touching while setting.\nWe did have a sit down because they stopped practicing her at practice for a while as well. They did start up again after we pointed it out. I do appreciate that they saw that issue at least, but the game stuff is still an issue.\nSo, thoughts? Is this normal for coaches? Are there red flags or am I just being overly sensitive? I know it is just from my perspective, but our school is so small that there is no athletic director and minimal/incomplete guidelines so there is not much I can do.",

        "selftext": "Hi all! I coach a middle grades girls volleyball team and were fairly decent. We typically go undefeated in our season. In our school district we have a reputation for being really good. I send most of my girls to very strong high school teams and they typically go varsity as freshman.\n\nBackstory over. Recently a private school reached out to me for a non-league scrimmage which i accepted, but their team is coed with mostly boys. My question is, should i suggest specific rules for this game? I‚Äôve never coached outside of girls vb and am mostly just concerned for their safety. \n\nPlease let me know if there are common rules boys should adhere to in this type of game. The only thing i saw that seemed common was no attacks in front of the attack line.\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\nI‚Äôve done a little bit of research in the meantime and here‚Äôs the rules i proposed (could be confusing but this came from USA VB rules):\n\nCoed team must have at least two females on the court playing at all times, more females are allowed but not more than four males.\n\nIf it‚Äôs a single contact over the net it must be from a girl, otherwise a female must touch the ball before it goes over.\n\nAny player can block but no back row males can attack.\n\nFINAL EDIT:\nI ended up canceling the game because after learning more about their team, it was very obvious that they were kind of a bomb squad of boys with a few girls to make it coed. He was not willing to adhere to some of my suggestions of coed rules, the biggest one being no attacking on the front row, staggering the rotation, boy, girl, boy, girl, boy, girl, and having at least one girl touch the ball before it comes over on rallies. They are a heavy boy team playing on a women‚Äôs net and their boys are anywhere between 5 foot 9 to 5foot 11 so it‚Äôs not a risk I want my girls to take. Thanks for all the advice. The other issue is that they at the end of their season with no more games and we are midseason.",

I've played relatively high-level volleyball through high school and have followed NCAA and VNL since I started playing 6-7 years ago. I feel that I understand the on-court side of playing pretty well.\n\nCurrently, my team has a fairly incompetent coach. I won't go into details, but I was specifically added to the team's leadership to deal with volleyball operations(planning practices, making rosters, and any strategic ideas). He doesn't really do anything and will constantly choose to blame leadership for decisions he's imposed on us.\n\n  \nAnyway, I feel fine making in-game calls(I did so at NCVF nationals last year), looking for matchups between hitters, and playing around with different blocking schemes. However, I need help deciding whether to mess around with the starting rotation to adapt to different teams. I do think it is a bit more nuanced than a yes or no question and a bit dependent on serving and such, but I also notice that the vast majority of teams at least at the club level chose to always receive in 6 and serve in 1 with no adjustments. \n\n\n\n**TL;DR: How much of an advantage does changing starting rotation actually give?**",

Salem Academy features the #1 player in 2a in Emma Brewer while Western Christian features the Tri-towers in the Herber sisters.  Clastskanie, the powerful #2 team from the Northwest League has a solid chance to play its way into the championship match based upon its bracket position with only #1 Crosshill Christian standing in its way.  Chrosshill Christian  though rated #1 has losses to both Western and Salem Academy and its schedule has been less then stellar. It's unfortunate that the OSAA is still using the two games at once format for the semifinals when the level of play certainly demands the full attention of the fans for each game and the girls deserve better. Portland Christian returns all the key players from the 2023 championship team but they did face a late season loss to rival Clatskanie.  Following in the tradition of Portland Christian Olympic gold medalist, Kim Hill, there are players in 2a who have decided to remain loyal to their small school environment when they are demonstrating skills that could take them to the best of 6a volleyball.

Out of court the thing that helped me the most was just doing delt/rotator cuff exercises. I'm hoping my shoulder health will naturally improve as I get stronger. Last year I wasn't able to go all out without my shoulder hurting even with extensive warm-ups, so my current state is a definite improvement.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, I need some feedback regarding players who have experienced shoulder bursitis.\n\nFor some context, I started playing volleyball four years ago. Last year, I went from two medium-intensity training sessions to three high-intensity ones, without being in good enough physical shape. As a result, I got injured and ended up with shoulder bursitis. My training sessions were on three consecutive days, as I couldn't organize them differently due to my work obligations.\nI am fully aware that I should have prepared myself better physically before training at that level of intensity. However, I was going through a tough time, and volleyball became the activity that helped me the most to regain mental and physical balance.\n\nFor the past two months, I‚Äôve been following a rehab program with a physiotherapist, reduced my training frequency, and now play at low intensity.\nI feel like I‚Äôm gradually gaining strength, and the pain is slowly decreasing, but it still persists.\n\nSince I play as a setter, setting and blocking don't cause any pain.\nHowever, attacking and serving do. I also often experience pain when I have to react quickly in unexpected situations, such as reacting to a dump. In daily life, I sometimes feel pain when I stretch or raise my arm too quickly.\n\nI‚Äôm not necessarily looking for recovery advice, but I'd like to hear your experiences regarding how long it took for the pain to disappear.\nOr more specifically, how did you adjust your training routines? Did you change anything? My physiotherapist is very competent, but I‚Äôd really appreciate feedback from experienced players who have been through the same situation.\n\nI know I need to stop when the pain becomes too intense, but I also understand that completely stopping isn‚Äôt good either, as the joint and body could become too deconditioned. I‚Äôve tried adapting my activity to be less demanding. And whenever I feel too much pain, I switch to setting only (in practice, we play all positions for the first part or do drills, followed by a half-hour match at the end).\n\nI think I currently have a lot of apprehension when preparing to attack, and I find it difficult to relax my shoulder.\nHow long did your rehab take, if you‚Äôve had this injury? And how long did it take before you regained explosiveness in your attacking motion? I know that bursitis, while not necessarily severe since I'm being properly treated, is frustrating because the recovery period can be long.\n\nDo you have any tips or advice on how you approached your training sessions? What changes did you make during the recovery period? If not, do you have any Intel that could benefit me ?\nRight now, I‚Äôm focusing on muscle strengthening and trying to correct my attacking technique, as I had a habit of not pulling my arm back enough and attacking too much from the side. I often found myself under the ball during attacks.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

        "selftext": "TLDR: The classic question - Sit with a good team or start with ok team.  Is it really that rude to ask when you are paying for it?\n\nU13 club tryouts are coming soon.  It is a large club so usually there are at least 6-7 teams per age group from U10 through U14. Goes from National 1 and 2 to further down in skill level.  My kid has been playing for the last 3 years in Rec, open gyms, clinics and ‚Äúpre club‚Äù style camps.  She proudly made her school team out of 55 players but was on the bench.  She was a ‚Äúgood player with a nice serve‚Äù ,  coaches words but she‚Äôs short and they took 4 girls to be Libero‚Äôs/defensive specialists.  The team had 15 girls total but that‚Äôs a different story.\n\nThe kid got feedback from the coach, played her heart out in practice and did what what she told but she couldn‚Äôt break into the top spots so got limited playing time.  To be fair the other kids were good too.  It was a big blow to her to sit like that and going into club I want her to play and not sit. Lessons were learned about sitting and not playing but supporting your team early in her rec career(crazy coaches) so that wasn‚Äôt what we were going for.\n\nI know some people think it‚Äôs madness to ask but since my club has so many kids/teams anyways can‚Äôt I just be straight with the coaches and tell them ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what team she‚Äôs on I just want her to be playing.‚Äù  To everyone that going to ask that‚Äôs what she wants too.  I don‚Äôt think local Rec is a good fit anymore as the kids there are total beginners.\n\nIs taking your lumps on the bench really how club ball has to be?  I just want a honest review and placement.  If she‚Äôs not good enough to start that‚Äôs ok too.  I would rethink the whole club ball journey.\n\nEdit: TLDR: I asked and the kid is starting the 2nd national team instead of bench on 1st team.\n\n\nIt worked itself out naturally.  I was approached by the National 1 coach who offered a spot day 1 of a 2 day tryout.  I asked where on the roster and was told 10-11.  We had an open, honest conversation about what mine and my kids wishes were and she killed it the second day and was offered a starting spot on National 2 team.  ",
