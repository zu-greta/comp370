The only loss in this earlier streak was also to Alcaraz, at his favorite tournament in Indian Wells. \n\nBoth streaks have included one major win and at least one M1000 win. \n\nHis 19-4 record between the Tsitsipas loss and Rublev loss was by far his worst stretch of the season. Each of the six losses this season were lost in the deciding set. ",
