#Why is the difference between found and designed data?
- found data is the data that already exists and you simply collect/scrape it from the source. you do not have any say in what the data looks like or the design/format it comes in.
- designed data is the data that comes from you formulating a survey or something that will shape the way someone answers and provides the data. You can decide what your needs are and collect data based on that. 

#What are the two primary challenges that necessitate sampling when collecting data?
- very large amounts of data. when there is too much data, you cannot take and analyse all of it.
- limited data collection allowed. for example, some apis could only let people take a certain limited amount of data.
- lack of api. you would have to resort to web scraping which could come with some complications.

#Why are website owners more likely to be upset about collecting data using scrapers than using APIs?
- since apis are provided by the owners, you would be collecting what they deem is okay for you to have. they can also decide on the amount of data you get from them by setting a limit
- when web scraping, there are no limits and so you could collect a lot of data, and use it however you want, which opens the question of content rights.
