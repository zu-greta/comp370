Look at the places where there were annotator disagreements. Where did annotators completely disagree? Where did they not completely agree? The disagreements are due to SOMETHING. What do you think it is? (It could be more than one thing)

# completely disagree
posts that included multiple questions, that could be classified in multiple places

# not completely agree
some slightly ambiguous posts that wernt included in the taxonomy

# reasons for disagreement
some posts can be ambigous and vague, with multiple questions posted all together. this can create cases where it is unclear which category to classify them in.
